                <h1>The future of real estate investing is fractional</h1>
                <p>Tokenizing real estate has become the focus of many institutions in 2018, and is likely to continue into the future as Ethereum offers a way to add improved levels of liquidity (tokens) to a notoriously illiquid industry (real estate).

                    Fractional ownership democratizes access to real estate investment, and therefore distributes and minimizes the risks and labor involved with owning property.  And RealToken makes it even simpler!
